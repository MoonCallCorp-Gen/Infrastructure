# Infrastructure

## Purpose
This repository is used for “vibe code” infrastructure:
- Testing future code and recording what works and what doesn’t
- Keeping a lightweight day-to-day progress log

## Files and folders
- `main.py` — helper functions and scripts
- `tests/test.json` — structured test results and evaluations
- `progress/YYYY-MM.txt` — daily progress log (one file per month)

## Rules
- Test results go in `tests/test.json`
- Daily notes go in `progress/YYYY-MM.txt`
- Files are appended to, never overwritten
